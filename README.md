# HeckLib
HeckLib is a TypeScript library intended to be accessible to all Beat Saber modchart creators. It should be easy to set up.

# Setup

## Visual Studio Code

### Installation
> You need to have <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSC</a> installed on your PC, you can install it from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here.</a>
> 
> Just follow the installation and after it's installed open it up.

### Map Setup
> Copy or downlaod the `example.ts` file into your map directory (where your `Info.dat` lives etc.)
> Then, either copy the repo to your map folder or run `npm i hecklib` in the terminal.

## Scripting

### Editing
> To edit the script, open your map folder in Visual Studio Code and start editing the `example.ts`. This file already contains the initialisation of the map.
>
> If you need any help with it, ask me on Discord: `Jevk#0004`

### Running The Script

> Press F5 in VS Code, which will run the script with a debugger attached. It is highly recommended to learn how to use a debugger for a much better developer experience.
> You can also run the script by going into the `Run and Debug` menu in VS Code and manually pressing run.
>
> You can also run it automatically on every save by using Nodemon.
