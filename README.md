# HeckLib
HeckLib is a TypeScript library intended to be accessible to all Beat Saber modchart creators. It should be easy to set up.

## Setup
HeckLib needs Deno to run properly, install it by following this manual https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.1/getting_started/installation

I am open to feedback: Jevk#0004
