# HeckLib
HeckLib is a TypeScript library intended to be accessible to all Beat Saber modchart creators. It should be easy to set up.

# Setup

## Deno

### Installation
> HeckLib needs Deno to run properly, install it by following <a href="https://deno.land/manual@v1.28.1/getting_started/installation">this manual</a>.
> 
> You can also just run `irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex` in Windows PowerShell.

#

## Visual Studio Code

### Installation
> Once you have Deno installed, you need to have <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSC</a> installed on your PC, you can install it from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here.</a>
> 
> Just follow the installation and after it's installed open it up.

### Extensions
> Visual Studio Code needs an extension to support Deno. You can find them by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + X` on your keyboard. This opens the extensions tab. Search `Deno` from the extensions. Install the first extension from the list, this should make Deno compatible with your VSC.

### Map Setup
> Go to the <a href="https://github.com/Heck-Library/HeckLib/releases">releases</a> and download the latest `HeckLib.zip` file from there.
> 
> Once you have the latest `HeckLib.zip` file, extract it to your map directory.

#

## Scripting

### Editing
> To edit the script, open your map folder in Visual Studio Code and start editing the `script.ts`. This file already contains the initialisation of the map.
>
> By just typing `new` and adding a space will give you a bunch of different things you can do with the script. Documentation for these will be added later.
> 
> If you need any help with it, ask me on Discord: `Jevk#0004`

### Running The Script

> Run the `run.bat` file either in Visual Studio Code or just in the CMD window by double clicking on it. Every time you press any key in the HeckLib window, it will run the script and update the stats.
> 
> I highly recommend installing a batch runner extension for Visual Studio Code, it will make it much easier to run the script in the same window while working with the code.
