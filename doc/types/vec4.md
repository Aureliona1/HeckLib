# Vector 4

## Usage

```ts
const vector: vec4 = [number, number, number, number];
```

## Explanation

`vec4` is a vector of 4 numbers. It can be used for the [`color`](../animations/color.md) animation property in case the animation needs only 1 keyframe for a reason or another.

This is also used in the static [`color`](../properties/color.md) property.
