# Effects

These are commonly used effects in maps that I've turned into short classes. The effects are highly customizable and very useful for new map creators, as well as experienced map creators. The effects are also very easy to use, and should be easy to understand. If you have any questions, feel free to ask about them on Discord: `Jevk#0004`.

## Wall Effects

- [Particle Tunnel](./particleTunnel.md)

## Note Effects

- [Note Trail](./noteTrail.md) - Visual effect for notes that leaves a dissolved trail behind the notes. As seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/4ko2Qu6nJuI?t=39" target="_blank">this map</a>.
- [Random Path](./randomPath.md) - An extremely common visual/gameplay effect randomizing the path of notes. As seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/1YJPOC9UCOI?t=216" target="_blank">this map</a>.
- [Move Path](./movePath.md) - This is a more advanced effect to create from scratch, especially with easings. This effect shifts the path of notes over time. Similar to <a href="https://youtu.be/ES3xMeOD-_A?t=16" target="_blank">this effect</a>. Pay attention to where the notes spawn.

## Other Effects

- [Distorion](./distortion.md) - This effect distorts the screen. It's a very simple effect, but it can be used to create some interesting effects. As seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/fAXp9AXCM0w?t=184" target="_blank">this map</a>.
