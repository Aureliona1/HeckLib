# Disable Note Gravity

## Explanation

The `disableNoteGravity` property is used to disable the gravity effect on notes. It's the effect that makes the note "jump" up upon spawning. This property is a boolean value. If the value is `true`, the gravity effect will be disabled. If the value is `false`, the gravity effect will be enabled.
